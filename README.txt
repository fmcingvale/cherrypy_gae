This is a port of CherryPy to Google's AppEngine.

For ease of use, this tree is ready to be cloned directly into your 
AppEngine project, no need to run an installer.

For more information and tutorials see http://boodebr.appspot.com

Recommended usage:

$ cd /my/app/project
$ git clone git://github.com/fmcingvale/cherrypy-gae.git cherrypy

It is possible this may be a short-lived tree - it really depends how many
modification are needed to run well on AppEngine. Mainly I wanted to try
out github.
